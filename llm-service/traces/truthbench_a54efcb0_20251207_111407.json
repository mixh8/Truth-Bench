We are currently in late August or early September 2025.\n2.  **The Event:** The question asks if Trump will restore local control of DC police *before* October 2025.\n3.  **Political Context (Simulated):** If Trump is President in August 2025, he likely took office in January 2025. The premise of the question implies that local control was previously taken away (perhaps federalized).\n4.  **Market Pricing:** The market is pricing \"Yes\" very high (80%), suggesting a strong expectation that this restoration is imminent or already in progress.\n5.  **Liquidity Warning:** There is 0 volume and 0 open interest. The spread is wide (75/85). This is an illiquid market.\n6.  **Strategic Analysis:**\n    *   If Trump federalized the police (a common campaign talking point regarding DC crime), restoring local control would likely be a specific policy concession or a return to normalcy after a specific intervention period.\n    *   However, the deadline is extremely close (less than 2 months away).\n    *   The price of 85 cents to buy \"Yes\" is very expensive for an event that requires affirmative action by a politician known for being tough on DC crime. Why would he give control *back* so quickly if he took it? Usually, the \"tough on crime\" stance involves *keeping* federal",

The drop from 85\u00a2 to ~61\u00a2 suggests the market has already started reassessing optimism. I estimate the true probability closer to ~52% than 63%, making NO slightly +EV at 35\u201339\u00a2. Since I already hold 60 NO at a favorable 25\u00a2 basis, I\u2019ll modestly add 40 more NO contracts rather than size aggressively, balancing edge with risk of a last-minute deal or executive action before Oct 1. This keeps total exposure reasonable while improving my average entry price and taking advantage of what I see as mild overpricing of YES.",

The resolution deadline is October 1, 2025. This implies we are currently in late August or early September 2025.\n2.  **Political Context:** The question implies Trump is currently in power (presumably having won the 2024 election) and has previously *removed* local control of the DC police (federalized them).\n3.  **Price Trend:** The price started high (85\u00a2) and has dropped significantly to ~63\u00a2. This suggests that despite initial expectations, the restoration of local control hasn't happened yet and time is running out (less than a month left until the Oct 1 deadline).\n4.  **Incentives:** If Trump federalized the DC police (a likely move for a \"law and order\" second term focused on the capital), he has little political incentive to return control to a local government that is likely hostile to him, especially on a short timeline. The trend downward reflects the market realizing that inertia is powerful.\n5.  **Time Decay:** With only weeks remaining until the deadline, the burden of proof is on the \"Yes\" side to show an affirmative action. Bureaucracy moves slowly. If it hasn't been announced by late August 2025, it is unlikely to be implemented by Oct 1.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe probability of 63% seems too high given the short remaining timeframe and the likely political reluctance to relinquish federal control once established.

      "raw_response": "Based on the market data and simulated timeline, here is the analysis and trading decision:\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Current Date Context:** The market is active in mid-November 2025. The question asks about a Continuing Resolution (CR) extending funding into early 2026 (specifically Jan 1 - Feb 1).\n2.  **Political Context:** In November of a non-election year (2025), Congress is typically finalizing appropriations for the fiscal year that started October 1st. If they haven't passed full appropriations bills, they are likely operating under a short-term CR that expires in December.\n3.  **The Specific Date Range:** The market specifies a CR that lasts \"through at least Jan 1, 2026 but not past February 1, 2026.\" This is a very specific window (effectively a 1-month CR for January).\n4.  **Market Sentiment:** The price has surged from 25\u00a2 to ~80\u00a2. This suggests strong news has broken indicating that Congress is coalescing around a strategy to \"punt\" the funding fight into early 2026, specifically January. This is a common tactic to avoid a shutdown right before the holidays (Christmas/New Year).\n5.  **Portfolio Position:** I currently hold 50 NO contracts bought at 85\u00a2. The current YES price is ~80\u00a2 (midpoint), meaning NO is worth ~20\u00a2. I am currently sitting on a massive loss (bought at 85\u00a2, now worth 20\u00a2).\n6.  **Strategy:**",

      "raw_response": "Based on the market data and simulated context, here is the trading decision:\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe market is asking about a specific Continuing Resolution (CR) scenario for late 2025. The current date appears to be mid-November 2025 (based on the market open/close dates provided). The market price for YES is extremely high (93\u00a2 bid / 97\u00a2 mid), implying a near-certainty that a CR fitting these specific dates will pass.\n\nHowever, I am currently holding 50 NO contracts bought at 85\u00a2. This is a losing position, as the price has moved against me significantly (from 85\u00a2 down to an implied ~3-7\u00a2 value for NO).\n\nThe specific dates are very narrow: \"through at least Jan 1, 2026 but not past February 1, 2026.\" This is a classic \"short-term punt\" CR often used during holiday standoffs. If the market is trading at 97\u00a2, news has likely already broken that a deal has been struck for exactly this timeframe to avoid a shutdown before the new year.\n\nHolding the NO shares is risky because they are likely to expire worthless if the deal is imminent. However, selling them now at ~3\u00a2 (implied by the 97\u00a2 YES price) recovers almost nothing. The only reason to hold is if there's a chance the deal falls apart or the date changes slightly (e.g., to Feb 15th), which would resolve this market NO.\n\nGiven the high volume and the price movement from 25\u00a2 to 97\u00a2, the market has reacted to specific news. My NO position is essentially dead. The",

      "raw_response": "Based on the market data and political context, here is the analysis and decision:\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Political Context:** Roger Wicker is a Republican Senator from Mississippi. Stephen Miran is a known conservative economist (former senior advisor at the Treasury under Mnuchin, fellow at the Manhattan Institute).\n2.  **Nomination Scenario:** If Stephen Miran has been nominated for the Federal Reserve Board in 2025, it is highly likely a Republican administration is in power (given the date is 2025, this implies the winner of the 2024 election). If a Republican president nominated Miran, Wicker (a mainstream Republican) would almost certainly vote to confirm him.\n3.  **Market State:** The market has 0 volume and a very wide spread (80\u00a2 bid / 100\u00a2 ask). The \"implied probability\" is listed as 90%, likely the midpoint.\n4.  **Trading Opportunity:** The ask is 100\u00a2, meaning I cannot buy \"Yes\" profitably (buying at $1.00 for a max payout of $1.00 is irrational).

      "raw_response": "Here is my analysis and trading decision:\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Political Context:** Roger Wicker is a Republican Senator from Mississippi. Stephen Miran is a potential nominee for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.\n2.  **Partisanship:** Typically, Republican Senators support Republican nominees and oppose Democratic ones, though Fed governors often get bipartisan support if they are viewed as technocrats. However, in recent years, Fed nominations have become more contentious.\n3.  **Nominee Profile:** Stephen Miran is known as a conservative economist (former senior advisor at the Treasury under Mnuchin). If the President nominating him is a Republican (which fits the timeline of a 2025 nomination if a Republican won in 2024), Wicker would almost certainly vote YES. If the President is a Democrat, it is highly unlikely they would nominate Miran.\n4.  **Timeline Inference:** The market dates (Aug/Sep 2025) suggest this is happening in the first year of a new presidential term. Given Miran's background, this scenario implies a Republican administration.\n5.  **Market Pricing:** The market is surprisingly wide (45\u00a2 bid / 69\u00a2 ask). The \"last\" or mid-market price seems to be around 57%, but the ask is quite high at 69\u00a2.\n6.  **Risk/Reward:** Buying YES at 69\u00a2 requires a high degree of certainty (approx 70%+). While Wicker is a reliable Republican vote, the wide spread suggests liquidity is low or there is uncertainty about whether the vote will actually happen *before* the deadline (Sep 15, 2025). The deadline is very tight (only about 2 weeks from market open).\n7.  **The \"Trap\":**",

      "raw_response": "Based on the market data and political context, here is the trading decision:\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Political Context:** Mike Crapo is a Republican Senator from Idaho. Stephen Miran is a potential nominee for the Federal Reserve. The scenario implies a Republican administration or a bipartisan nomination process in 2025. If this is a Republican administration (e.g., Trump or similar), Crapo would almost certainly vote YES for a conservative nominee like Miran (who has been associated with conservative economic circles). If it's a Democratic administration, the nomination of someone like Miran would be highly unusual or part of a specific deal, making Republican support likely necessary.\n2.  **Market State:** The market has 0 volume and a very wide spread (80\u00a2 bid / 100\u00a2 ask). The \"implied probability\" of 90% is just the midpoint or an automated calculation, but the lack of liquidity means the price discovery is poor.\n3.  **Price Action:** The ask is 100\u00a2. This means to buy \"YES\", I have to pay $1.00 for a contract that pays out $1.00. There is zero potential profit in buying YES at the current ask price.\n4.  **Opportunity:** The bid is 80\u00a2. This means I can sell YES (or Buy NO) at 80\u00a2? No, usually \"80\u00a2 bid\" means someone is willing to buy YES at 80\u00a2. If I want to bet NO, I would be selling into that bid. However, the prompt format usually implies I am a taker. If I want to Buy NO, I am taking the \"NO\" side",

This price action strongly suggests that the event has either become impossible (e.g., the nomination was withdrawn, the vote failed, or the candidate was rejected) or is extremely unlikely to happen before the deadline. The current price of ~2% implies a 98% chance of \"No\".\n\nI currently hold 50 NO contracts bought at 56\u00a2. The current value of NO shares is effectively ~96\u00a2-100\u00a2 (since YES is 0\u00a2-4\u00a2). I have a significant unrealized profit.\n\nSince the YES price is at the floor (0\u00a2 bid), I cannot sell my NO shares for their full theoretical value of 100\u00a2 easily because buying YES at 4\u00a2 to close the position would eat into profits, and there might not be liquidity to sell NO directly at a high price. However, holding is the most logical play here to wait for resolution at $1.00, assuming the event is indeed dead. Buying more NO shares (by shorting YES) is impossible/inefficient at this price floor. Buying YES would be a \"longshot\" bet, but given the crash, it's likely throwing money away.\n\nThe best move is to HOLD the winning position to maturity to collect the full payout, as exiting now might incur slippage or spread costs.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"hold\",\n  \"quantity\": 0,\n  \"confidence\": 98,\n  \"probability_yes\": 0.02,\n  \"reasoning\": \"The market has crashed to near zero (",

Stephen Miran, if nominated by a Republican administration for the Federal Reserve, would likely receive support from Republican senators. Cornyn has historically been a reliable vote for Republican nominees. The market implies 90% probability which seems reasonable given typical partisan voting patterns on Fed nominations. However, I'm slightly less confident than the market (88% vs 90%) due to potential unknown factors about Miran's nomination or any controversy. The wide bid-ask spread (80-100) suggests low liquidity, so I'm taking a moderate position. Buying at the ask of 100 cents would be overpaying, but if I can get closer to 80-90 cents, this represents fair value.",

      "raw_response": "Here is my analysis and trading decision:\n\n**Market Analysis:**\nThe market asks if Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) will vote to confirm Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve Board.\n1.  **Political Context:** John Cornyn is a senior Republican Senator. Stephen Miran is a known conservative economist (former Treasury official under Mnuchin). Typically, Republican Senators vote to confirm Republican nominees, especially if the nomination is coming from a Republican president (which is implied by the 2025 date if Trump won in 2024) or if it's a compromise pick.\n2.  **Price Action:** The market has a very wide spread (43\u00a2 bid / 72\u00a2 ask). The last trade or mid-market price seems to be around 57.5%, but the ask is quite high at 72\u00a2. The price has trended down from 75\u00a2 to the current levels, hitting a low of 44\u00a2. This suggests growing skepticism or a lack of movement on the nomination.\n3.  **Timing:** The market opened Aug 29, 2025, and closes Sep 16, 2025. This is a very short-term market (about 2 weeks). The deadline is Sep 15. If a vote hasn't been scheduled yet, the \"No\" side becomes very strong simply due to time constraints.\n4.  **Liquidity:** The volume is low (658 contracts), and the spread is huge (29 cents). Buying YES costs 72\u00a2, while buying NO costs 57\u00a2 (100 - 43).\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThe wide spread makes entering this market expensive. To buy",

      "raw_response": "Based on the market data provided, here is the analysis and trading decision:\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Price Action:** The market has crashed from a high of 89\u00a2 down to 1\u00a2 (with a 0\u00a2 bid / 3\u00a2 ask). This indicates a near-certainty that the event will *not* happen.\n2.  **Context:** The market opened on August 29, 2025, and closes on September 16, 2025. The current price suggests that either the nomination has been withdrawn, the vote has been scheduled for after the deadline, or it is widely known that the vote will not occur/succeed.\n3.  **Risk/Reward:** Buying \"NO\" at this point is difficult because the price is likely near 99\u00a2 (implied by the 1\u00a2 YES price). Buying \"YES\" at 3\u00a2 is a lottery ticket.\n4.  **Specifics:** The question asks if Cornyn will vote *for* confirmation. If the nomination is dead or the vote is delayed past Sep 15, the answer is No. The collapse in price suggests the nomination is likely dead or delayed.\n5.  **Opportunity:** While the probability is extremely low (1.5%), buying YES contracts at 3\u00a2 offers a 33x payout if a miracle occurs. However, usually, a drop to 1\u00a2 in a political market means the event is effectively cancelled or the nominee withdrew.\n6.  **Decision:** The spread is 0\u00a2 bid / 3\u00a2 ask. I cannot sell YES because I don't own any. I could buy NO, but the price isn't explicitly listed (it would be the inverse of YES, so likely",

As a Republican senator, he is more likely than not to support a GOP-aligned Fed nominee, but there is still meaningful risk: possible partisan maneuvering, concerns about Miran\u2019s perceived hawkishness or views, or procedural complications that could lead to a no vote or absence. I estimate the true probability of a YES vote around 78%, below the market\u2019s ~90\u2013100% implication, making NO slightly +EV at 20\u00a2. Liquidity is thin (no volume, no OI), so I size modestly (40 contracts) to limit risk while taking advantage of what looks like an overconfident market on the upside scenario.",

      "raw_response": "Based on the market data and political context, here is the analysis and trading decision:\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Political Context:** Todd Young is a Republican Senator from Indiana. Stephen Miran is a known conservative economist (former senior advisor at the Treasury under Mnuchin, fellow at the Manhattan Institute).\n2.  **Partisan Alignment:** Assuming a Republican administration or a bipartisan nomination scenario (given the 2025 date), Young is a reliable Republican vote for conservative nominees. Miran fits the profile of a nominee a standard Republican senator would support.\n3.  **Market State:** The market has 0 volume and a very wide spread (80\u00a2 bid / 100\u00a2 ask). The \"Implied probability\" of 90% is just the midpoint, but the actual cost to buy YES is 100\u00a2 (which is impossible to profit from) or to place a limit order.\n4.  **Liquidity Issue:** There are no sellers at a reasonable price. The ask is 100\u00a2. Buying at 100\u00a2 guarantees zero profit even if the event happens.\n5.  **Strategy:** While the event is highly likely (Young voting for a conservative nominee), the market mechanics make it uninvestable at the current Ask price. I cannot buy YES at 100\u00a2. I could place a limit order to buy YES at a lower price (e.g., 85\u00a2 or 90\u00a2), but the prompt format generally implies taking immediate market action or holding. Since I cannot buy YES profitably, and betting NO seems fundamentally wrong (betting against a Senator voting for his party's likely nominee), the only logical move is to HOLD or",

      "raw_response": "Based on the market data provided, here is the analysis and trading decision:\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe market is pricing the probability of Todd Young voting \"Yes\" at virtually zero (1.5% implied, with a 3\u00a2 ask). The price history shows a catastrophic collapse from 75\u00a2 down to the current lows, suggesting a major event has occurred\u2014likely that the nomination has been withdrawn, failed a procedural vote, or Young has publicly announced opposition that kills the nomination.\n\nI currently hold 30 NO contracts bought at 56\u00a2. The current NO price is effectively 97\u00a2-100\u00a2 (inverse of YES). I have a significant unrealized profit.\n\nHowever, the YES price is so low (3\u00a2 ask) that buying NO contracts (selling YES) offers very little upside (risking ~97\u00a2 to make 3\u00a2). Conversely, buying YES contracts at 3\u00a2 is a \"lottery ticket\" play. If there is *any* chance the market has overreacted or if a surprise procedural move happens before Sept 15, 2025, the payoff is 33x.\n\nGiven the extremely low price, the market is signaling the event is dead. My existing NO position is almost fully maximized. I could sell my NO shares to lock in profit, but since the price is near 0 for YES, holding the NO shares to expiry (paying $1) is likely the best move to capture the full spread, unless I need liquidity.\n\nHowever, looking at the \"Buy YES\" side: Is there a 3% chance of a reversal? Usually, when a confirmation market hits 1-3%, it's done. But buying YES at 3\u00a2 is a cheap hedge or a high-risk/",

      "raw_response": "Here is my analysis and trading decision:\n\nThe market is asking whether Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) will vote to confirm Stephen Miran as a Federal Reserve Governor.\n\n1.  **Political Context:** Stephen Miran is generally considered a conservative economist (formerly at the Treasury under Mnuchin, fellow at the Manhattan Institute). Tommy Tuberville is a conservative Republican Senator. Typically, Republican Senators vote to confirm Republican-nominated or conservative-leaning nominees.\n2.  **Market State:** The market has extremely wide spreads (80\u00a2 bid / 100\u00a2 ask) and zero volume. The \"implied probability\" of 90% is just the midpoint or an artifact of the platform's calculation, but the actual liquidity is non-existent.\n3.  **Price Analysis:** To buy \"YES\", I would have to pay the ask price of 100\u00a2 (or close to it, depending on the order book depth not shown, but the ask is listed at 100). Buying at 100\u00a2 offers zero upside (max payout is $1) and infinite downside risk if he votes no or abstains.\n4.  **Strategy:** Even if I believe Tuberville is very likely to vote yes (which is plausible given the ideological alignment), I cannot buy YES at 100\u00a2. There is no profit margin. Conversely, betting NO at 20\u00a2 (selling into the 80\u00a2 bid) might be interesting if I thought there was a chance of a protest vote, but 80\u00a2 is the *bid* for YES, meaning I could sell YES (short) or buy NO at a price derived from that. Wait, the bid is 80",

      "raw_response": "Based on the market analysis below, here is the trading decision.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Wide Spread:** The bid/ask spread is massive (44\u00a2 vs 72\u00a2). Buying YES costs 72\u00a2, but selling it back immediately would only net 44\u00a2. This indicates extremely low liquidity and high risk. To break even on a YES buy, the true probability needs to be >72%. To break even on a NO buy (buying at 100-44 = 56\u00a2), the probability of NO needs to be >56% (or YES < 44%).\n2.  **Political Context (Simulated/Inferred):** Tommy Tuberville is a conservative Republican. Stephen Miran is generally known as a conservative economist/strategist (often associated with Hudson Bay Capital and former Treasury roles under Mnuchin). This suggests ideological alignment. Republicans generally vote for Republican nominees unless there is a specific scandal or hold.\n3.  **Price Action:** The price has dropped from a start of 75\u00a2 to a current ask of 72\u00a2, with a low of 50\u00a2. The \"Implied Probability\" is listed as 58%, which is likely a mid-point or last trade price, but the actual cost to enter is 72\u00a2.\n4.  **Value Proposition:**\n    *   *Buying YES at 72\u00a2:* Requires high certainty. While Tuberville is likely to support a conservative nominee, paying 72 cents is expensive for a single Senator's vote which could be affected by attendance issues, \"holds\" on nominations (which Tuberville is famous for), or broader political maneuvering.\n    *   *Buying NO (selling YES)",

      "raw_response": "Based on the market data provided, here is my analysis and trading decision:\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Political Context:** Tim Scott is a Republican Senator. Stephen Miran is a known conservative economist (former senior advisor at the Treasury under Mnuchin, fellow at the Manhattan Institute). If a Republican administration (likely Trump, given the 2025 date) nominated him, Scott would almost certainly support him. If a Democratic administration nominated him, it would be highly unusual, but Scott might still support a moderate conservative.\n2.  **Market State:** The market has 0 volume and 0 open interest. The spread is extremely wide (80\u00a2 bid / 100\u00a2 ask). The \"implied probability\" of 90% is just the midpoint or an algorithmic estimate, but the actual liquidity is non-existent.\n3.  **Price Action:** To \"Buy YES\", I would have to pay the ask price of 100\u00a2 (or close to it if I place a limit order, but the ask is listed at 100). Buying at 100\u00a2 offers 0% upside (max payout is $1). It is impossible to make a profit buying YES at 100\u00a2.\n4.  **Contrarian Play:** To \"Buy NO\", I would likely be selling into the bid of 80\u00a2 (effectively shorting YES) or buying NO contracts if they were listed separately (usually inverse of YES). If I can buy NO at a price implying <20% probability (i.e., paying <20\u00a2), it might be worth a flyer, but the bid is 80\u00a2 for YES. If I sell YES",

      "raw_response": "Here is my analysis and trading decision:\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe market is asking about a specific Senate confirmation vote for a Federal Reserve Governor nominee, Stephen Miran. The timeline is set in late August/early September 2025.\n\n1.  **Political Context:** Ted Cruz is a Republican Senator known for a conservative, often hawkish stance on monetary policy. Stephen Miran is generally associated with conservative economic circles (having served in the Treasury under Mnuchin/Trump). If a Republican president nominated him (which is plausible given the 2025 timeline implies a new administration or a late-term appointment), Cruz would likely support him. If a Democratic president nominated him, it would be unusual but Cruz might still support a conservative nominee, or oppose on partisan grounds.\n2.  **Market State:** The market has 0 volume and 0 open interest. The spread is extremely wide (80\u00a2 bid / 100\u00a2 ask). The \"Implied probability\" is listed as 90%, likely just a midpoint or algorithmic calculation based on the wide spread.\n3.  **Liquidity Risk:** There is effectively no liquidity. Buying YES would cost 100\u00a2 (guaranteed no profit, only risk of loss). Buying NO is not possible because there are no bids for NO (which would be the offers for YES, but the ask is 100\u00a2). Wait, the bid is 80\u00a2 for YES, meaning someone wants to buy YES at 80. The ask is 100\u00a2.\n4.  **Trading Opportunity:**\n    *   I cannot buy YES because the ask is 100\u00a2. There is zero upside.\n    *   I",

Given the relatively tight time window to resolution and the lack of new specific information here about Cruz\u2019s stance or whip counts, there isn\u2019t a clear enough edge to justify adding to either side or crystallizing a loss now. The best move is to hold the current NO position and wait for more information or for the vote outcome, rather than trading against a modestly mispriced but not egregious market.",

      "raw_response": "Based on the market data provided, here is my analysis and trading decision:\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Context:** The market is asking about a specific confirmation vote (Stephen Miran for Fed Governor) by Senator Ted Cruz. The timeline is very short (Aug 29, 2025 to Sep 15, 2025).\n2.  **Political Dynamics:** Ted Cruz is a Republican. Stephen Miran is generally associated with conservative economic policy (having served in the Treasury under Mnuchin/Trump). If a Republican president nominated him (which is likely given the 2025 date implies a new administration or a late-term appointment), Cruz would typically support the nominee unless there is a specific ideological rift.\n3.  **Market Pricing:** The spread is extremely wide (51\u00a2 bid / 72\u00a2 ask). This indicates low liquidity and high uncertainty. The \"last price\" or mid-market is around 61.5%, but to buy YES, I have to pay 72\u00a2. To buy NO, I effectively sell at 51\u00a2 (or buy NO at ~49\u00a2).\n4.  **Risk/Reward:** Paying 72\u00a2 for a \"Yes\" implies a 72% probability requirement to break even. While Cruz is likely to vote \"Yes\" on a conservative nominee, 72\u00a2 is a steep price for a single senator's vote which could be derailed by scheduling issues, a \"present\" vote, or political grandstanding. Conversely, betting \"No\" (buying NO at ~49\u00a2) requires believing there's a >50% chance he *doesn't* vote yes.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The wide spread makes entering this market very expensive. Paying 72\u00a2 is too",
