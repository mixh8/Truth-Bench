Create a new tab called "Analyze" that replicates the "KalshiBotAI" interface for deep-dive market analysis. 

This tab allows the user to select a specific Prediction Market and see a "Consensus Analysis" generated by our 6 LLM models.

### 1. The Layout (Split Pane)
Use a layout identical to the attached screenshot (KalshiBotAI style):
* **Left Sidebar (30% width):** "Live Markets" Feed.
* **Right Panel (70% width):** The "Active Analysis" View.

### 2. Left Sidebar: Live Markets List
Create a vertical list of market cards. Each card must display:
* **Tag:** (e.g., "Economics", "Crypto", "Weather").
* **Ticker & Title:** e.g., "FED-CUT-MAR25" / "Fed Interest Rate Cut".
* **Prices:** Large "YES" price (e.g., 13¢) and "NO" price (87¢).
* **Visuals:** Use a subtle border glow (Green) for the selected active market.

### 3. Right Panel: Aggregate Analysis (The Core Feature)
When a market is selected, the right panel displays the "Super-Forecast" derived from all 6 models.

**A. Header Section**
* **Market Title:** Large bold text.
* **Definition:** A brief sentence describing the contract terms.

**B. "AlphaBench Consensus" Box (The 'Recommendation' Card)**
* *Style:* Large card with a bright green outline and background gradient (like the screenshot's "Buy YES" box).
* **Recommendation:** Display the aggregate vote (e.g., "BUY YES").
* **Confidence Score:** Calculate the average confidence of the 6 models (e.g., "78% Confidence").
    * *Logic:* If 5 models say YES and 1 says NO, confidence is high.

**C. "Consensus Reasoning" (The 'AI Reasoning' Box)**
* *Style:* Dark card with blue/purple border.
* **Summary Text:** Generate a paragraph that synthesizes the "thoughts" of the models.
    * *Format:* "The consensus is bullish. **Grok** and **GPT-5** highlight strong momentum indicators, while **Claude** advises caution due to macro headwinds. However, with **DeepSeek** identifying a distinct arbitrage opportunity, the aggregate signal suggests an undervaluation of the 'YES' contract."
* **Key Factors:** Bullet points summarizing the main arguments (e.g., "• Underestimated inflation cooling").

**D. Model Vote Breakdown (New Feature)**
* Below the reasoning, show a row of small badges for the 6 models.
* Each badge shows the Model Name and their specific Vote (YES/NO).
    * *Example:* [Grok: YES] [Claude: NO] [Gemini: YES]...

**E. Execution Footer**
* **Input:** "Contracts" number input field.
* **Cost:** "Est. Cost" calculation.
* **Button:** A large, full-width Green Button: "Execute BUY YES" (with arrow icon).

### 4. Styling Details
* **Font:** Monospace for numbers/tickers (JetBrains Mono or similar).
* **Colors:** Deep Navy/Black background (`bg-slate-950`), Neon Green (`text-emerald-400`) for profits/confidence, Muted Blue (`text-slate-400`) for secondary text.
* **Icons:** Use Lucide-React icons for "External Link", "Activity", and "Trending Up".
